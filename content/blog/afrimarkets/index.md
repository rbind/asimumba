**African Markets indices performance tracker**

A minimal project tracking selected African markets indices. The data used in the dashboard comes from the [African Markets](https://www.african-markets.com/en/) website.

The goal is to keep this updated with data mined to Google sheets. I have leveraged on Google Data Studio for the visualizations and its continuous integration to Google sheets to pull the latest data as it becomes available.
